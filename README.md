# Google Data Analysis Certificate Cyclistic Case Study

I was presented with the following question to answer: How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
To answer this question I started by downloading the data for the project: https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html.
I downloaded the data from October 2021 to September 2022. The license for the data can be found here: https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement.

## Analysis
The analysis is provided in this repository. Conducting the analysis reinforced my knowledge of common R functions, and I learned some that were completely new to me.
I followed the instructions from the course, and I was able to conduct my analysis and answer the original question.

## Presentation
I used Tableau to create visualizations of the data I wanted to focus on. I made sure to use contrasting colors and an easily readable format
to keep it accessible to shareholders. I created a presentation in Google Slides which I would use to present my findings, conclusions, and recommendations.
